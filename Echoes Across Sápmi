Echoes Across Sápmi: The Journey of Sámi Drums
This is a story map that explores the explores the rich history and cultural significance of Sámi drums, sacred objects
central to Sámi spirituality and community life. Drums were used by noaidis (religious leaders) for healing, prophecy, 
and maintaining harmony. By tracing the journey of these drums, the author aims to highlight their socio-cultural 
and historical contexts.

Key Historical Contexts:

1. Drums in Museums:
   - A Sámi drum from central Sweden, presented to the Royal Society in 1681, is now in the British Museum, stripped
    of its cultural context.
   - Another drum, confiscated during witch hunts in Vadsø, Norway, eventually returned to the Sámi Museum in 1979, 
     sparking discussions about repatriation.

2. Collections Across Europe:
   - Thousands of Sámi artifacts, including over thirty sacred drums, are housed in European museums, often lacking 
     proper documentation.
   - The Museum of European Cultures in Berlin contains the largest collection of Sámi objects outside Scandinavia, 
     with ongoing efforts to improve their display and cultural understanding.

3. Cultural Resilience:
   - The story of a seventeenth-century drum from Lule Sápmi, hand-carried back to Sweden in 1998, symbolizes resilience.
    It has inspired new Sámi artisans like Helge Sunna and Gunvor Guttorm, who integrate traditional craftsmanship with modern
    creativity.

4. Historical Displacement:
   - The Museum Schefferianum in Uppsala collected Sámi drums in the late seventeenth century, dispersing them to royal
     collections and museums across Europe.
   - The Freavnantjahke gievrie, a significant drum, reflects the pressures faced by Sámi elders and the ongoing legacy 
     of cultural appropriation.
